# Style options.
#

# The name-tag-list option determines what tag is used as the name of a
# feature.  The value of the tag will overwrite the 'name' tag before
# being used in the style.
#
# You can specify a list here, the first one that exists will be
# used.
# 
# Example:
# name-tag-list = name:en, int_name, name
# if an element has the 'int_name' tag and the 'name' tag then name is
# reset to be the value of the 'int_name' tag.

# The levels specification for this style
#
levels = 0:24, 1:22, 2:20, 3:18, 4:16
# More levels may make zooming smoother, but it will generate larger map tiles.
#levels = 0:24, 1:22, 2:21, 3:20, 4:19, 5:18, 6:16
